Hey you!

Welcome to my blog. You probably don't know who I am so let me introduce myself.

{{< google-maps height="500" width="800" lat="-11.702902" lng="43.25222" zoom="5" >}}

I was born the 6th of February, 1992, in a little archipelago between Africa and Madagascar called 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comoros" target="_blank">Comores</a>.
Born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroni,_Comoros" target="_blank">Moroni</a> the capital city of Comoros.
But actually I did not lived there, you see Comoros are made of 4 islands and I lived the first 8 years of my life on the island of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayotte" target="_blank">Mayotte</a>.

I lived a quiet and peaceful life there, without knowing the cold, the pollution or other #FirstWorldProblem.
I think it's at that time that I begun to be interested in computers.
I remember playing hours and hours at Tomb Raider, Crash Bandicoot, Tekken and other 90s games on the PlayStation 
first of its name, King of the Andals and the first man, protector of the seven.. wow wrong quote.

When I was playing, I remember asking father, mother and other relatives HOW video games are made. 
It was so fascinating it seemed almost magical.

Then my father wanted a better future for his sons, so we moved to France in 2000 (not my first time there, we travelled a lot
at that time), in the south of France, at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseille" target="_blank">Marseille</a>.

We did not stay very long there, almost a year, until we moved for what is now my city for the last 16 years: 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon" target="_blank">Lyon</a>.

(Actually we live in the suburb of Lyon, at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Priest,_Rh%C3%B4ne" target="_blank">Saint-Priest</a>
but it doesn't really matter)

Those 16 years here have been fantastic. It's a part of my childhood, all of my teenagehood and the beginning of my adulthood.


From elementary school to high school I saw the football team of my city, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympique_Lyonnais" 
target="_blank">l'Olympique Lyonnais</a> win 7 successive domestic titles (a record in France.. and maybe in Europe?). 
I remember every big wins and defeats. I saw them beating Real Madrid for years (3-0, 2-0, 1-0, and in round of 16). 
I was sad when they lost the most important games in the Champions League. You probably get now that this is my favorite football teams.

I had my first computer in 2003 at 11. A kick-ass Packard Bell that lasts 8 years, which for today electronic devices seem like an eternity. 
With it, oh boy, I have so many hours of play-time. I don't play a lot of different games, but when I choose a game it's for 1000's hours.
Mostly on this computer I played a korean MMORPG called Rappelz, Trackmania, Civilization, GTA San Andreas and you can already guess my favorite 
game: FIFA.

Like every teens of my generation, the internet was my playground. We stayed hours chatting on MSN, laughing at memes and 
watching videos on Dailymotion and later Youtube. Everyone of us had a Skyblog (a kind of french tumblr at that time) or a MySpace 
(I did not have, and never 'get it'). And all of a sudden, Facebook was THE thing to have (funny how none of my friends are using facebook now..)

Alright let's go back a little bit. We are somewhere between 2005 and 2006. Maybe sooner, maybe later I don't recall. 
I found a website that changed my life and is one of the main reason why I wanted to be a web developer.

You know how people says that Apple revolutionized the smartphone industry right? So who revolutionized the web industry? 
Remember how websites looked like in 2000-2010? Basically, it was kind of like looking at.. documents? And you were just scrolling in the page til the end 
unless there were some link and you clicked on it and another document to scroll etc. How did we go from that era to interactive website, live-streaming 
content and 360° videos?

For me, there is this website that blew my mind and I will not be surprised if it was the same for the web industry. This website is.. Google Earth. 

Remember, I mean remember! Almost all of the websites looked like documents with some colors, pictures and links. And then there was Google Earth. 
This shit was LIT yo (and still is). You could see the Earth, turn around it, zooming to some random area in the world and just, playing around. 
It was as interactive as.. as a video game in a web browser! This was my second HOW did they make it. That's it. This. Right there. 
I wanna make some awesome cool stuff on the web when I'll be an adult. This was my calling to become a web developer.

And here I am, after 4 years of IT school education, 2 years of internship as a junior web developer and a road trip around northern Europe this year.

This was my story, Nayed Saïd Ali, 25 and ready to become a professional web developer. Thanks for reading. :mic dropping:
