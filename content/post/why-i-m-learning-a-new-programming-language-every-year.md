title: "Why I'm Learning a New Programming Language Every Year"

<em>Before I start this post, let me be clear about something here:

the goal isn't to master a new programming language every year.
I repeat, the goal is <strong><u>not</u></strong> to master a new programming language.
Neither to be like [this](http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/4a/4a3e4f9e2c8194f18e6a0ed55ba9b0ccee9469efdb0a6fa08e51a282c0e0e200.jpg).
I really want to emphasize on that.</em>

I remember at school we were learning C#, this was my first programming language. And then a couple of weeks later we began learning 
Python and I was like "wait, there are [OTHERS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages) programming languages?"

Since then, I've been learning (not really on purpose I admit) at least one programming language every year:

* 2011: [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) and a little bit of [Python](https://www.python.org/) (school)
* 2012: [PHP](http://php.net/) and a little bit of [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)) (school)
* 2013: [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) (school)
* 2014: [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
* 2015: [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* 2016: [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)
* 2017: [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/)

<em>(I may do a quick review of each languages in a future post)</em>

So what's the point? Why spend time learning different languages when I can just learn one and master it? 

> Learn at least one new language every year. Different languages solve the same problems in different ways. 
By learning several different approaches, you can help broaden your thinking and avoid getter struck in a rut.

<em>quote from [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer)</em>

The main goal here is to open your mind and teach yourself different style of programming. There are so many different programming languages 
out there using disparates paradigms. We have imperative languages, procedural languages, object oriented languages, 
functional languages and probably other that I don't know.

I can clearly see the divergence in my code when I'm learning a new paradigm. 
For instance, since learning Rust I sometimes think of the [lifetime](https://rustbyexample.com/scope/lifetime.html) of a variable when 
I'm coding in another language. Since Elixir (functional), my Ruby code (object oriented) is not the same, I don't see every problem as 
"I have this entity which is an object, and this other entity which is another object" but more like "I have this data, and I want to 
transform it to look like this data" (I am not trying to say that x paradigm is better than y, and frankly I don't care).

`<troll>` Since Javascript I see the world as a pile of crap `</troll>` (disclosure: I actually like JS)

In a way, I'm trying to grow my technical skills. I've seen people (particularly in the php and java world) that learned one programming 
language to the point of mastering it (yes I know we can't really master one but you get the idea) and when they had to touch some 
Javascript they began to panic like

I'm not saying that you should learn a bunch of languages and be a 
[Jack of all trades, master of none](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_of_all_trades,_master_of_none)! No!!!
All I'm saying is that you should definitely be comfortable in at least 2 programming languages that uses different paradigms 
(for me right now it's Elixir/Javascript and a little bit of Ruby) and explore how many different languages you want. 

I don't know yet what will be my 2018 programming language ([though](https://crystal-lang.org) [I](https://www.haskell.org) 
[may](https://clojure.org) [have](https://kotlinlang.org) [some](http://elm-lang.org) [contenders](https://golang.org)).

Without any transition, let me share with you this quote from the creator of C++:

{{< tweet 888532544169402369>}}


The perfect programming language does not exist. So if you truly do like programming, like you do not see it just as your work, 
trust me on this: play with other languages, it's fun. It is fun. Be open-minded. Be curious.

Until next time, PLUS ULTRA.
